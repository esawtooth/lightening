## Architecture

Lightning employs a microservices architecture built on Azure Functions and managed services:

### Core Components

1. **Event API Gateway** (`PutEvent`) – Central HTTP endpoint that receives authenticated JSON events and publishes them to Azure Service Bus for asynchronous processing
2. **Temporal Scheduler** (`Scheduler` + `ScheduleWorker`) – Stores future events in Cosmos DB and dispatches them at scheduled times using cron expressions or timestamps
3. **AI Chat Engine** (`ChatResponder`) – Processes `llm.chat` events using OpenAI's models, maintaining conversation context and generating intelligent responses
4. **Message Dispatcher** (`UserMessenger`) – Routes `user.message` and `llm.chat.response` events to connected clients via webhooks or WebSocket connections
5. **Container Orchestrator** (`WorkerTaskRunner`) – Dynamically provisions Azure Container Instances to execute tasks, scripts, and CLI tools in isolated environments
6. **Agent Framework** – Extensible system supporting multiple AI agents (OpenAI Shell Agent, Echo Agent, custom agents) for specialized task execution
7. **Identity & Access Management** (`UserAuth`) – Handles user registration, authentication, and JWT token management with secure credential storage
8. **Web Interface Layer** – Chainlit-based chat UI and FastAPI dashboard providing intuitive interfaces for interacting with the platform
9. **Infrastructure as Code** – Pulumi scripts for automated provisioning and management of all Azure resources

### Data Storage

- **Cosmos DB**: Multi-tenant document storage for users, repositories, schedules, and application state
- **User Repositories**: Persistent state management for user-specific data including key files, reports, personal details, diaries, journals, and contextual information required for task execution
- **Azure Service Bus**: Message queuing and event routing with guaranteed delivery
- **Azure Storage**: Function app storage and temporary file handling

### Security & Networking

- **Managed Identity**: Azure AD integration for secure service-to-service authentication
